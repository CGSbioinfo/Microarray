## Array processing
RNA was assessed for concentration and quality using a SpectroStar (BMG Labtech, Aylesbury, UK) and a Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Cheadle, UK). Microarray experiments were performed at Cambridge Genomic Services, University of Cambridge, using a species specific // Array Plate (Affymetrix, Wooburn Green, UK) in combination with WT PLUS amplification kit (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100ng Total RNA was amplified along with inline PolyA spike in control RNA, using the WT PLUS amplification kit (Affymetrix). Successfully amplified samples were labelled using the GeneChip WT terminal labelling kit (Affymetrix) using the in line hybridization controls. Plate arrays were processed on the GeneTitan instrument (Affymetrix) using the GeneTitan Hybridization, Wash and Stain kit (Affymetrix). Samples were hybridized to the array, washed, stained and scanned using the array specific parameters provided by Affymetrix. Finally basic visual quality control was performed using Command Console Viewer (Affrymetrix) prior to bioinformatic quality control.
