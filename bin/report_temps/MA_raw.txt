## MA plots {.tabset}
The MA plot is used to show variations in intensity for a sample against a pseudo sample constructed using the intensity of all the samples. M (y axis) is the log ratio of intensity between the sample and the pseudo sample and A (x axis) is the mean average of intensity. Ideally the data will be close to the y=0 line. It is expected that the data will display more noise (deviation from the y=0 line) at low intensity than at high intensity. Outlier samples for technical reasons can be spotted as they might show a large deviation from the central line, such as large cloud of data spreading far from the y=0 for the whole intensity range. Trends in the data can also be seen using this plot. For example, "banana" shaped plots are usually indicative of technical variation between samples. This type of trend should be corrected by the normalisation.

### Raw data {.tabset}
In the raw data MA plot we can see that the data displays variation in intensity levels, the spread of the data is quite wide, especially at low intensity ranges. However there are no unexpected variation when moving from low to high, the regression line (in red) is fairly flat for most samples.
