### Nuse boxplot
NUSE stands for Normalised Unscaled Standard Error, the fitting of individual probe error in the Probe Level Model (PLM). The PLM models the expression measures using a M-estimator robust regression, in other word it fits a model to the probe-intensity data. Here we use the standard error of this model to check the sample quality. The NUSE values are standardized at the probe level across the arrays, median values for each probe-set are set to 1. The boxplot is useful to check that all the distributions are centered near 1. An array with a boxplot centered around 1.1 or higher is flagged as bad quality. If one array shows a higher spread of NUSE distribution, its standard error is higher than the rest and it is also a sign of bad quality. The data shows that there is some variation between arrays but the data does not look too bad.
