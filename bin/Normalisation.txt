# Normalisation 
## Normalisation method 
The processing of the data to generate normalised intensity is done using Robust Multichip Analysis [@RMA]. This method summarizes the intensities of all probes covering a gene, constructing a model containing a "probe" and a "chip" effect. The advantage of this model is in the use of all the arrays available to give a more robust model and better normalisation across the whole experiment. All the arrays will be normalised together as the robustness of the normalisation increases when including more chips. When filtered, the probes are filtered according to the intensity level, by default at least 2 samples must have probes with signal above the median for whole set of probe set, e.g. all the probes on the array. Given the number of probes, it is likely that a good number of them will not be above background. Therefore using the median intensity level should give us a good estimator to identify medium to highly expressed probes. Keeping too many probes when performing the comparisons will have detrimental effect on power as it increases the stringency of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) multiple testing correction.

## Normalisation QC
All the QC graphs that were generated for the raw data are also regenerated for the normalised data, in order to check whether there are any issues caused by normalisation. Please check the section in the technical QC part for the normalised data graphs.
