### Positive and negative controls
Negative controls: is the set of putative intron based probe sets from putative housekeeping genes. Specifically, a number of species specific probe sets on 3' IVT arrays were shown to have constitutive expression over a large number of samples. The genes for these probe sets were identified and multiples of four probe probe sets were selected against the putative intronic regions. Thus in any given sample some (or many) of these putative intronic regions may be transcribed and retained. Furthermore, some (or many) of the genes may not be constitutive within certain data sets. These caveats aside, this collection makes for a moderately large collection of probe sets which in general have very low signal values.  

Positive controls: is the set of putative exon based probe sets from putative housekeeping genes. Specifically, a number of species specific probe sets on 3'IVT arrays were shown to have constitutive expression over a large number of samples. The genes for these probe sets were identified and multiples of four probe probe sets were selected against the putative exonic regions. Thus in any given sample some (or many) of these putative exonic regions may not be transcribed or may be spliced out. Furthermore, some (or many) of the genes may not be constitutive within certain data sets. These caveats aside, this collection makes for a moderately large collection of probe sets which in general have moderate to high signal values.  

These probe sets are used to estimate the true positive rate for the pos_vs_neg metric. The pos_control and all_probeset categories are useful in getting a handle on the overall quality of the data from each chip. Metrics based on these categories will reflect the quality of the whole experiment (RNA, target prep, chip, hybridization, scanning, and griding) and the nature of the data being used in downstream statistical analysis.
