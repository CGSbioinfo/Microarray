## Bioinformatics 
After scanning the files generated by the scanner (CEL files) are loaded in R using the oligo package from bioconductor [@oligo]. No background correction or normalisation is applied at this stage. A Guanine-Cytosine Count Normalisation (GCCN) and Signal Space Transformation (SST) is applied to the raw CELs at this point [@GCCN]. In order to assess the quality of the data, plots of the control probes are generated along with boxplot, MAplot and intensity distribution plot. Variation within biological replicates is also investigated using clustering methods. The raw data are then processed using the Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) method [@RMA]. The data are background corrected, normalised using quantile and summarized. Once the data are processed, the comparisons are performed using the limma package [@lima] and the results corrected for multiple testing using False Discovery Rate (FDR)[@fdr].
